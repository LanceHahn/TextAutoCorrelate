# TextAutoCorrelate
A text version of auto-correlate will be created that will run on a text document and produce a list of longest word strings with a 2+ frequency

This morphed into a relatively simple analysis in which all n-grams of whatever length are reported if they have a frequency above a certain threshold.

08/06/18 - It is currently a working draft.  

My intention is to update it in the future to be more like an autocorrelation.  The idea is that repeated elements, particularly large repeated elements would be visually highlighted.
